**第二节（20分）**

假设你是红星中学高三学生李华。你的英国好友 Jim 想参加 China Daily 举办的“Photo Beijing”照片征集活动。为此发来邮件，就拍摄内容询问你的建议。  
请你用英文给他回复，内容包括：  

1. 提出的建议；  
2. 建议的理由。  

**注意：**  
1. 词数100左右；  
2. 开头和结尾已给出，不计入总词数。  

Dear Jim,  

It's my honor to offer my suggestions on the "Photo Beijing" pooling actitivity. I'd like to recommend the Baidaling Great Wall in Beijing.

Originated in ~~Qing~~ Qin Dynasty, the Great Wall has an extensive history of two thousand years. First and foremost, the history of Beijing is ~~waved~~ woven into the fabric of every bricks. While most people would picture the beauty of the Forbidden City, the Great Wall has its unique ancient charm, as far as I'm concerned. Besides, the Great Wall is a marvellous wonder created by ancient Chinese, which shows that Beijingers are capable of conquering the nature, which can make your work stand out. Lastly, the Great Wall is not only located in Beijing. Instead, the Great Wall connects different places with Beijing, resembling the bonds between Beijingers and other people nationwide. In times of difficulty, the Great Wall always holds people together, demonstrating the spirit of Beijing——inclusive and resilient.

I hope my advice can help you get a better result. Looking forward to your early reply.

Yours,  
Li Hua

### ❌ 存在问题及修改建议：

#### 1. **语言表达不够准确**
- **原句**：*Originated in Qing Dynasty*  
  ❌ 错误：长城始建于秦代，非清代；“Originated”用法不自然。  
  ✅ 修改建议：*Built over two thousand years ago, the Great Wall has witnessed centuries of Chinese history.*

- **原句**：*the history of Beijing is waved into the fabric of every bricks*  
  ❌ 错误：“waved”用词不当；“bricks”应为单数或改为“every brick”。  
  ✅ 修改建议：*The history of Beijing is woven into every brick of the Great Wall.*

- **原句**：*Beijingers are capable of conquering the nature*  
  ❌ 错误：nature 前不加 the。  
  ✅ 修改建议：*It shows the wisdom and determination of the Chinese people in overcoming natural challenges.*

#### 2. **逻辑稍显牵强**
- 第三个理由：“长城连接各地，象征北京人的包容与坚韧”虽然立意不错，但与前两个理由相比略显抽象，联系不够紧密。  
  ✅ 修改建议：可简化为“长城不仅是北京的象征，也是中华民族精神的体现，能让照片更具深度和感染力。”

#### 3. **词汇和句式可更丰富**
- 当前句式多为“... is...”，“... shows that...”结构，略显单一。  
  ✅ 可适当使用定语从句、分词结构等提升表达层次。

### ✅ 修改后版本（仅供参考）：

Dear Jim,

I'm glad to offer my suggestions for the "Photo Beijing" contest. I would **highly recommend** shooting the Badaling section of the Great Wall.

First, with a history of over 2,000 years, the Great Wall is not only a symbol of Beijing but also **a testament to ancient Chinese wisdom**. Unlike the more commonly photographed Forbidden City, the Great Wall presents a majestic and timeless beauty. Moreover, it reflects the resilience and spirit of the Chinese people, which can **add depth to** your photo. Finally, as a structure that connects different regions, it also represents unity and inclusiveness — key values of Beijing today.

I hope these ideas help you create **a standout piece**. Looking forward to your work!

Yours,  
Li Hua
